                        <p>Eugene provides various types of components of different levels of abstraction, i.e., Device, Part Type, and Part. Devices and Parts have one pre-defined attribute, i.e. sequence, and various pre-defined operations, such as toSequence() or size().</p>

                            <center><p>Part Type</p></center>
                            <p>Part Types represent types of standard biological parts, such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, or terminators. Part Types do not construct any parts, but rather specify the structure and properties of part that can be constructed. All properties referenced by a Part Type definition must be defined before the Part Type's definition.</p>

                            <p>Devices represent a composite of standard biological parts and/or other devices. In a device declaration, the same part and/or device can be used more than once. Eugene allows synthetic biologist to specify abstract, instantiated, and hybrid synthetic devices. Abstract devices are only assembled of part types, such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, or terminators. Hybrid devices are devices that are assembled of other devices, part types, and parts.</p>

                        <p>Part instantiations define instances of predefined Parts Types and assign concrete values to the Part Type's properties. Eugene provides two possibilities to set the property values of Parts:<br/>
                            1.a comma-separated list of values can be specified, by specifying the property values in the same order as specified in the Part Type declaration.<br/>
                            2.the name of the properties can be specified to which the given value should by assigned to.<br/>
                            The property values of a part can be accessed using the 'dot' operator by first specifying the part name, followed by a dot ('.'), and the desired name of the property.

                            <p>In Eugene, only abstract devices can be instantiated. Instantiated devices consists of parts, such as pLac or lacI. Each part must be an instance of the corresponding part type in the abstract device.<br/>
                            Device concreteDevice(p2, rbs1, RFP, t1);<br/>
                            Property values of devices can be accessed with the dot operator; however, the value is the union of the property values of its members returned as a list. If the property is a txt or num, a txt[] or a num[] is returned. If the property is a txt[] or a num[], a txt[] or a num[] is also returned that consists of the lists appended together. Individual members can be accessed by using square brackets and specifying an index. The first member is indexed at zero. Square brackets can be stacked in the case of devices within devices.<br/>

                        Eugene offers facilities to declare arrays of Devices, Device Instances, Part Types, Part Instances and Properties. Every array of synthetic biological components can only contain elements of the corresponding biological component, for example, a Device[] array can only consist devices. Similar to num[] and txt[] arrays, the elements of arrays of synthetic biological components can be accessed by using squared brackets, where the index is zero-based. Arrays may access the built in functions get and size.
