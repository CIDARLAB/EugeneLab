                        <p>Eugene supports line and block comments.</p>
                        <p> Examples:</p>
                        <center><p>// This is a line comment</p></center>
                        <br>
                        <center><p>/* This is</p></center>

                                        <center><p><strong>Declaration of Primitives/Variables</strong></p></center>
                    <p>Eugene supports three types of variables -- boolean, txt, and num. A variable of type boolean can have one of the two values: true or false. A txt variable is a string of characters, and a num variable can store a number. Multiple declarations of the same type can be made on one line by separating assignments by commas.</p>
                    <p>boolean b; <br>txt txt1,txt2, txt3; <br> num num1,num2, num3;</p>
                    <br/>

                        <center><p><strong>Declaration of Arrays</strong></p></center>
                        <p>Eugene supports txt[] arrays, which is a list of txt values, and num[] arrays, which is a list of num values. The txt or num values of an array can be accessed by specifying an index between squared brackets. The first element of an array is indexed with zero (0).</p>
                        <p>txt[] arrayTxt1, arrayTxt2; <br> num[] arrayNum;</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <center><p><strong>Expressions and Assignments</strong></p></center>
                        <p>Eugene supports the following types of operations: The + operator can be used to add numbers, concatenate txt variables or values, and to concatenate arrays. The –, *, and – operators can be only be used to subtract, multiply, and divide num variables or values respectively.</p>
                        <p>The = assignment operator sets the value of the destination to the source, as long as types match. In the previous examples, the sources were primitive values, references to primitive values, references to property values of parts, and references to property values of devices. The destinations were all references to primitives; however, references to part property values can be set like this, as well. A property can be set to a property even if the property names are not the same, as long as types match. The properties of devices cannot be set. Parts and devices cannot be set to references to other parts and devices. Assignments of values to variables can be written at the declaration of a variable or an array, as well as everywhere in the entire Eugene script. If the variable or array at the left side of the assignment is not declared, the variable will get assigned the value and type of the right side of the assignment.</p>
